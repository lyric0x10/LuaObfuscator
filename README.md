# LuaObfuscator

### What this is:
The purpose of this project is to reformat code into a highly obfuscated state, which makes it nearly impossible to decompile or retrieve the original source. By using advanced techniques, we try to improve the security and integrity of the code, making it difficult for anyone to understand, replicate, or change its intended functions. Ultimately, this project aims to completely remove the risks of getting your code stolen and unwanted modifications or changes, ensuring strong protection and stelth.
